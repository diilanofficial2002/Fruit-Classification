# Image Classification with Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that classifies images into specific categories, such as different types of fruits and vegetables. The solution leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification and provides an intuitive user interface to upload and classify images.

## Objectives
- Build a deep learning model to classify images into predefined categories.
- Understand the fundamentals of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
- Gain experience in image preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the trained model with a user-friendly interface.

---

## Features
- **Upload Images:** Classify images directly using the user interface.
- **Batch Processing:** Classify multiple images in one batch.
- **Save Results:** Export classification results to a CSV file.
- **Pre-trained Model:** Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model for accurate classification.
